# UtteranceQueue

`UtteranceQueue` (from `scenerystack/utterance-queue`) manages a first-in-first-out queue of `Utterance`s and drives an `Announcer` (such as `AriaLiveAnnouncer` or `SpeechSynthesisAnnouncer`) to actually speak them. It is generic over the announcer type — `UtteranceQueue<A extends Announcer = Announcer>` — and is what's wired up under the hood for PhET's Interactive Description and Voicing features; simulation code almost never constructs one directly, but understanding it explains why alerts appear delayed, reordered, or dropped.

```ts
import { UtteranceQueue, AriaLiveAnnouncer, Utterance } from 'scenerystack/utterance-queue';
```

## A minimal example

```ts
const announcer = new AriaLiveAnnouncer();
const utteranceQueue = new UtteranceQueue( announcer );

// Somewhere the announcer's aria-live elements need to be in the document,
// and stepTimer needs to be stepped each frame for the queue to advance.

utteranceQueue.addToBack( 'Simulation reset' );

const scoreUtterance = new Utterance( { alert: 'Score: 3' } );
utteranceQueue.addToBack( scoreUtterance ); // re-adding later updates timing instead of duplicating
```

`UtteranceQueue.fromFactory()` is a convenience factory that wires up an `AriaLiveAnnouncer`, appends its live-region container to `document.body`, and drives `stepTimer` off `requestAnimationFrame` — useful outside a full `Sim`, where `joist` already does this wiring for you.

## Constructor

```ts
new UtteranceQueue<A extends Announcer>( announcer: A, providedOptions?: UtteranceQueueOptions )
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `debug` | `false` | Logs queue activity (`addToBack`, `announcing`, etc.) to the console |
| `initialize` | `true` | If `false`, the queue is never stepped (no `stepTimer` listener is added) and `addToBack()`/`addToFront()`/`announceImmediately()` become no-ops (via `initializedAndEnabled`) — useful for a feature flag that disables announcing entirely without branching call sites. Methods like `removeUtterance()`/`clear()` are unaffected |
| `featureSpecificAnnouncingControlPropertyName` | `null` | `'descriptionCanAnnounceProperty'` or `'voicingCanAnnounceProperty'` — additionally gates announcing on that Utterance-level Property, on top of `canAnnounceProperty` |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `addToBack( utterance )` | Enqueues an `Utterance` (or raw `TAlertable` content, auto-wrapped). Removes any existing occurrence of the same `Utterance` instance first |
| `announceImmediately( utterance )` | Bypasses queue ordering, subject to `priorityProperty`: if nothing is currently announcing, or this Utterance should cancel what is, it's moved to the front of the queue and announced synchronously (or left queued at the front if the announcer isn't ready yet); otherwise it is dropped without being queued at all. Needed for effects that must originate from a synchronous user gesture (browser speech-synthesis restrictions) |
| `removeUtterance( utterance )` | Removes a specific `Utterance` from the queue (not gated by `enabled`) |
| `hasUtterance( utterance )` | Whether the given `Utterance` is currently queued |
| `cancelUtterance( utterance )` | Removes it from the queue, and asks the announcer to stop if it's currently being spoken |
| `clear()` | Empties the queue without touching in-progress announcement (not gated by `enabled`) |
| `cancel()` | `clear()` plus tells the announcer to stop speaking entirely |
| `.muted` / `setMuted()` / `getMuted()` | While muted, Utterances still move through the queue and their timers still run, but nothing is sent to the announcer |
| `.enabled` / `setEnabled()` / `isEnabled()` | While disabled, `addToBack()`/`addToFront()`/`announceImmediately()` no-op and the queue no longer steps toward announcing anything; explicit `removeUtterance()`/`clear()` calls still work |
| `.length` | Number of Utterances currently queued |
| `UtteranceQueue.fromFactory()` | Static convenience constructor described above |

## How ordering works

Utterances are announced first-in-first-out, but only once "stable" — see `Utterance`'s `alertStableDelay`/`alertMaximumDelay` — and `priorityProperty` can reorder or interrupt: a higher-priority `Utterance` added while a lower-priority one is being spoken cancels it outright; a higher-priority `Utterance` already ahead in the queue causes newly-added lower-priority ones to be dropped rather than piling up behind it.

::: warning `addToFront()` is deprecated — don't reach for it
`addToFront()` logs a deprecation warning and rarely does what it looks like it should, because ordering is driven by time-in-queue and priority, not insertion position. To make something speak sooner, use `announceImmediately()`, raise its `Utterance.priorityProperty`, or `clear()` the queue before adding the important alert — not `addToFront()`.
